# Day 1 - Lab

Below are the lab items that are going to be covered.

- ***Applying Azure Policy to Arc Enabled Servers:***

     In this lab environment we are using [**Jumpstart ArcBox for IT Pros**](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_jumpstart_arcbox/itpro) as vm environment.  
     As previously stated please make sure "Microsoft defender for Cloud" environment settings have been enabled prior to lab described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/enable-enhanced-security). 

    Make sure all of the settings are enabled and defender uses the Log Analytics Workspace that ArcBox has created as shown in the screenshots
    [Defender Plans settings](/Day1/pics/defender1.jpg) and [Setting & Monitoring](/Day1/pics/defender2.jpg).

    Arcbox has already created some of the Policies, we'll omit these and assign our own policy settings that should be used in customer deployments.
    Please assign Initiatives/Policies listed below within **Resource Group** scope following the article [Tutorial: Create a policy assignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/learn/tutorial-assign-policy-portal#create-a-policy-assignment):

        Legacy - Enable Azure Monitor for VMs (This Initiative is required to configure dependency agent as well as Log Analytics agent on the VMs)
        Audit Windows machines that do not have the specified Windows PowerShell modules installed
        Audit Windows VMs with a pending reboot

    For further reference, you can find the list of Policies and Initiatives for Arc Enabled Servers [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/policy-reference).

- ***Update Management v2:***

    1. follow the article to assign Update management V2 Policies

- ***Inventory / Change Tracking***


    1. Please check if Automation account is created in ArcBox RG. If not, please create one. 
    following the article [Create a new Automation account in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-create-standalone-account?tabs=azureportal#create-a-new-automation-account-in-the-azure-portal).

    2. Please check if Change Tracking and Inventory is enabled for the Automation account. If not, please enable folowing the article [Enable Change Tracking and Inventory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/change-tracking/enable-from-automation-account#enable-machines-in-the-workspace)
    
    3. Follow the article [Manage Change Tracking and Inventory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/change-tracking/manage-change-tracking)
    In this article exercie the scenarios below:
        * Configure file tracking on Windows
        * Configure file tracking on Linux
        * Track file contents
        * Enable tracking for file content changes
        * View the contents of a tracked file
        * Track registry keys
        * Search logs for change records

- ***Remote  Connect SSH***

    We are going to make ssh connection to one of the Windows Arc enabled Servers. SSH server services needs to be enabled on the server side. 

    1. Logon to one of the Windows Servers using Hyper-V console on Arc Box vm and enable SSH server following the article

    [Get started with OpenSSH for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=powershell)

    Make sure "OpenSSH SSH Server" and "OpenSSH Authentication Agent" services are started on the Arc enabled server.

    2. Enable SSH on azure connected machine agent and enable connection points following the article
 
    [SSH access to Azure Arc-enabled servers - Azure Arc | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/ssh-arc-overview?tabs=azure-cli)

    3. Try remote SSH to Arc Enabled Server using command line  
    

- ***Azure Key Vault***

    We'll be exercising to deploy a self-signed certificate to Arc enabled Server using Azure KeyVault.

    1. Follow the article to create [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal#create-a-vault) 

    2. Follow the article to [Set and Retrieve Certificate from Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal)
    
    3. Create access policy on Azure Key Vault you have created. You can configure permissions on your vault by going to it in the Azure Portal, clicking Access policies in the navigation pane, and then Add Access Policy.

     In the Secret permissions drop down, tick the boxes for Get and List. Then, next to Select Principal, click None selected to open the AAD object picker. 

    Search for your Arc enabled server by its name, click it, then click Select. Click Add to finish configuring the Arc enabled server's permissions then click Save to commit the change.
    
    4. Modify and run the following lines in the below PowerShell script

```Powershell
$Settings = @{
  secretsManagementSettings = @{
    observedCertificates = @(
      "https://YOURVAULTNAME.vault.azure.net/secrets/YOURCERTIFICATENAME"
      # Add more here in a comma separated list
    )
    certificateStoreLocation = "LocalMachine"
    certificateStoreName = "My"
    pollingIntervalInS = "3600" # every hour
  }
  authenticationSettings = @{
    # Don't change this line, it's required for Arc enabled servers
    msiEndpoint = "http://localhost:40342/metadata/identity"
  }
}

$ResourceGroup = "ARC_SERVER_RG_NAME"
$ArcMachineName = "ARC_SERVER_NAME"
$Location = "ARC_SERVER_LOCATION (e.g. eastus2)"

New-AzConnectedMachineExtension -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup -MachineName $ArcMachineName -Name "KeyVaultForWindows" -Location $Location -Publisher "Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault" -ExtensionType "KeyVaultForWindows" -Setting (ConvertTo-Json $Settings)
```
