# Day 3 - Lab

## Container Apps on Arc Enabled Kubernetes (takes about 1 hour)

Before start be sure about below recommendations:

1. Do not use corp account for azure portal!
2. For the first lab scenario there is a definition as:

WORKSPACE_NAME="$GROUP_NAME-workspace"

But, it is used as **wORKSPACE_NAME** afterwards. 
Be sure to change **wORKSPACE_NAME** to **WORKSPACE_NAME** with capital **W**!

Lab Steps:

-   Environment configuration [Enable Azure Container Apps on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/azure-arc-enable-cluster)
