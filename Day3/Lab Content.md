# Day 3 - Lab

## Container Apps on Arc Enabled Kubernetes (takes about 1 hour)

Before start be sure about below recommendations:

```
Do not use corp account for azure portal!

For the first lab scenario there is a definition as:

WORKSPACE_NAME="$GROUP_NAME-workspace"

But, it is used as **wORKSPACE_NAME** afterwards. 
Be sure to change **wORKSPACE_NAME** to **WORKSPACE_NAME** with capital **W**!
```
